<h1>Playing a Concert</h1>

<p>Playing a concert can be a great fun! Or it can be totally scary! Sometimes both at the same time.</p>
<p>So we've put together a list of our top tips for great concerts.</p>
<h2>Write a set-list</h2>
<p>A <strong>set-list</strong> is a list of all your songs in the order you'll play them.</p>
<p>Make copies for everyone.</p>
<p>Print it <strong>BIG!</strong> so that you can still read it if it's down by your feet on the floor, or if the lighting isn't very good.</p>
<p>Remember your spares</p>
<p>Some instruments have parts that need to be replaced if they wear out or break. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>guitar strings</li>
<li>saxophone or clarinet reeds</li>
<li>drumsticks</li>
</ul>
<p>Make a list of the spares you might need and make sure you know where they are in an emergency</p>
<h2>Plan where you'll be on the stage</h2>
<p>Before you start to set up your instruments, take a few minutes to decide where you're all going to be.</p>
<ul>
<li>Will the drums be center stage? Or off to one side?</li>
<li>Is there a power socket for the amplifier if your guitar player stands on the right?</li>
</ul>
<p>It's much better to think about all this <strong>before</strong> you start setting up your instruments. It's really annoying if you have to start unplugging things and swapping places once you've begun to set things up!</p>
<h2>Know where you're going, when you're on</h2>
<p>If you're playing a concert womewhere you've never been before make sure you know where it is. Print out a map or set the GPS before you leave. There's nothing worse than being lost in an unfamiliar place a half hour before you're due onstage</p>
<p>And when you do arrive, the first thing you should do is <strong>find out what time you're on</strong>. Times often change. Ask whoever is running the event when you'll be on. Don't get caught off guard!</p>
<p class="top-tip">If you hit a wrong note or make a mistake, don't stop playing - just keep going and look as though you meant it!</p>
